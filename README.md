Data Analysis and Statistical Inference by Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel
====================================================================


This is a set of lecture notes taken during the [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/course/statistics) *Data Analysis and Statistical Inference by Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel*:

  * [DASI.md](https://github.com/for-coursera/DASI/blob/master/DASI.md) is a raw Markdown file
  * [DASI.Rmd](https://github.com/for-coursera/DASI/blob/master/DASI.Rmd) is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) project file for the compilation with [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/)
  * DASI.css is an additional Cascading Style Sheets file needed for the HTML compilation 
  * [DASI.html](https://github.com/for-coursera/DASI/blob/master/DASI.html) is a compiled HTML file (open it [here](https://for-coursera.github.io/DASI/DASI.html))
  * [DASI.pdf](https://github.com/for-coursera/DASI/blob/master/DASI.pdf) is a compiled PDF file (with page breaks).

In most cases, you are expected to be interested in either the Markdown file, the compiled HTML file, or the PDF document.

Note that GitHub doesn't support [footnotes](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html#footnotes), thus the display of the aforementioned [Markdown file](https://github.com/for-coursera/DASI/blob/master/DASI.md) may have issues.
