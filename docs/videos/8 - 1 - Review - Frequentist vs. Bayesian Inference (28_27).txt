In this video we're going to review
frequentist versus bayesian inference.
In the frequentist paradigm we make
decisions based on p values.
And in the bayesian paradigm we make our
decisions using posterior probabilities.
We're going to work with the same problem,
the same data set, use these two
different approaches, and check to see if
we arrive at the same answer or not.
And if we don't, we're going to discuss
why that might be the case.
This is going to be a somewhat calculation
heavy video because we
are going to review a whole bunch of
concepts at once here.
So we are going to keep the example light,
and work with M&Ms.
Suppose that we have a population of M&Ms,
and in this
population the percentage of yellow M&Ms
is either 10 or 20%.
We are only considering these two
possibilities here.
You have been hired as a statistical
consultant to
decide whether the true percentage of
yellow M&Ms is 10%.
You're being asked to make a decision.
And there are associated payoffs and
losses that you should consider.
So before we move on, let's check to see
what these payoffs and losses might be.
Here's your decision table.
We said that the true state of the
population
can either be 10% yellow M&Ms or 20%
yellow M&Ms.
Say that you decide that the percentage of
yellow M&Ms is
indeed 10% and that is the true state of
the population.
Then, you made the correct choice, and
your boss gives you a bonus.
Say on the other hand, you decided that
the true proportion of yellow M&Ms is 10%,
but
the true state of the population is 20%,
you
made the wrong choice, and you lose your
job.
You might also decide that the percentage
of yellow M&Ms is 20%, and if that
is your decision but the true state says
that percentage of yellow M&Ms is 10%.
Once again, you've made a mistake, so
you'd lose
your job, or if you decide that the true
proportion
is 20%, and that is indeed the case, you
make
the right decision, and your boss gives
you a bonus.
Obviously, you're going to be making this
decision using data.
You can buy a random sample of M&Ms from
this population.
Each M&M is going to cost you $200, which
is indeed pretty steep.
But remember data collection can be pretty
costly.
And you must buy five M&Ms at a time.
So you get to spend a $1,000 at a time.
You have a total of $4,000 to spend, which
means
that you could either buy five, ten, 15,
or 20 M&Ms.
And the decision is up to you.
Let's start with how we would set this
problem up under the frequentist paradigm.
Your hypotheses are the null hypothesis,
is that the percentage of M&Ms
is 10% and the alternative is that the
percentage of M&Ms is 20%.
The test statistic that you're going to be
using is going to be the number of yellow
M&Ms in the sample that you collect,
depending
on whatever you decide your sample size to
be.
And remember that the definition of the p
value is the probability of
observing this many or more yellow M&Ms,
given that the null hypothesis is true.
And when we say this many, what we mean is
however many
you observe in the sample that you decide
to buy from this population.
The first question you need to answer is
how many M&Ms would you buy?
Five, ten, 15, or 20?
And before you answer that question, think
for a second.
What is the cost or the benefit or, of
buying fewer or more M&Ms?
The benefit obviously is, as you increase
your sample
size, your decisions are going to be more
reliable.
And remember that the cost of making a
wrong decision is pretty high here.
You could lose your job.
So you want to make sure you are fairly
confident of your decision.
At the same time though, the data
collection is costly as well.
So you don't want to just willy nilly go
out
and buy large samples if you don't need
them, right?
So, if you believe that you could actually
make a correct decision using a smaller
sample size, you might choose to do so and
keep your money in your pocket.
I'm going to choose to be adventurous and
stick
with a small sample size because I want to
keep
some of my money on the data collection
end,
and go with a sample size of five only.
However, if you've decided to go with a
larger sample size,
you're going to get to see how your
decision would pan
out because we're actually going to
consider all possibilities in our
calculations, and take a look at what
decisions we would have made.
If we had gone with larger sample sizes as
one, the next question
you want to answer is what significance
level are you going to use.
Remember, in hypothesis testing we start
by setting
our hypothesis, then we collect data, then
we calculate
our test statistic and our p value, and
then
we compare this p value to our
significance level.
And if the p value is smaller than the
significance
level, we reject the null hypothesis in
favor of the alternative.
In this course we've seen a significance
level of 5% being used pretty often.
And that is the case in literature and in
practice as well.
But you might choose to go with something
else.
And in order to determine what threshold
you want to use
for yourself, we want to remind ourselves,
what is the significance level?
Remember that the significance level is
also
the probability of the type one error
rate.
So really the decision on what
significance level to set is about what
are the pros and cons of using a lower or
a higher significance level.
And since this is equivalent to the
probability of a type one
error rate, that is rejecting the null
hypothesis when it's actually true.
We want to really think about, do we want
to keep this error rate as low as
possible?
Which seems like obviously we do.
But at the same time, there may be some
benefits
from keep the significance level on the
slightly higher side.
Because we want to make sure that any
signal that
we have in the data, we're able to capture
it.
So if you set a very, very conservative
significance level.
Meaning a really, really tiny alpha, it
might be that you
might miss a significant effect when
you're doing your hypothesis test.
We're going to stick, for this example,
with a norm that we've
been using in this course, and stick with
a significance level of 5%.
So, just to recap, our null hypothesis is
that the percentage of yellow M&M's is
10%.
An alternative hypothesis is that the
percentage of yellow M&Ms is 20%.
Here's our sample.
Remember I had decided to stick with a
sample size of five.
So, I have a red, a green, a yellow, a
blue and an orange M&M.
In this case, the number of yellow M&Ms in
the first five draws is one.
Remember, the P value is the probability
of observed or more extreme outcome and
that
it's extreme in the direction of the
alternative
hypotheses given that the known hypotheses
is true.
So we can phrase this for this question,
the
probability of one or more yellows, given
that the
proportion of yellow M&M is 10% and
remember that
we're also given a sample size of five
here.
So how are we going to calculate this
probability?
What we have here is a binomial outcome,
with probability
of success of 0.10 and a sample size of
five.
And what we want to find is the probably
that
the number of successes is greater than or
equal to one.
This is going to be equivalent to 1
minus the probability of success being
equal to 0.
Let's pause for a moment and think about
why this is the case.
In a sample space with five trials, you
could have zero successes, one
success, two successes, three successes,
four successes, or five successes.
If you're interested in number of
successes being
greater than or equal to one, that means
the only thing you're not interested in is
the number of successes being equal to
zero.
In this case these two outcomes are
complements of each other.
So, therefore probability that the number
of successes is greater than or equal to
one, can be calculated 1 minus the
probability of successes equaling zero.
Zero success basically means five failures
and the probably of
a failure is 0.9 since the probably
success was 0.1.
So here what we have 1 minus 0.9 to the
fifth power.
Which is going to be equal to
approximately 41% or 0.41.
So our p value is approximately 0.41,
which is greater than R
significance level of 5% so we would fail
to reject the null hypothesis.
We're going to use this table to take a
note of our calculations as we go along.
So, in this case, we saw a sample size of
five.
And the number of yellow M&Ms in the first
five was one.
And we calculated the P value as the
probability of k or more yellow.
So, that's one or more yellows for the
sample that we were working with.
Given that the true proportion of yellow
M&Ms was 10%.
And we calculated a p value of 0.41.
In this case, with a p value of 0.41, we
would fail to reject the null hypothesis.
And conclude that these data do not
provide convincing
evidence that the percentage of yellow
M&Ms is 20%.
And if we have to make a decision between
the
two, we would stick with p is equal to
10%.
Next let's repeat these calculations if we
had
decided to go with the sample size of ten.
This is what the sample size looks like.
So our first five are exactly the same,
and
our additional size are blue, blue, green,
orange, and yellow.
There are two yellow M&Ms in this sample
of ten,
therefore our P value can be calculated as
probability of
two or more yellows, given that the
probability of success
is 10% and we have a sample size of ten.
Once again, we can use the binomial
distribution.
The p is still 0.10, but this time our
sample size is ten.
And our p value is the probability that
the
number of successes is greater than or
equal to 2.
How are we going to calculate this?
Well, we can simply make use of R real
quick.
Remember that to calculate binomial
probabilities, we use the function dbinom
and the outcomes that we're interested in
are anything between two and ten.
So we want to calculate the individual
binomial probabilities
for two, three, four all the way up to
ten.
And sum these over.
The second argument we plug in is our
sample size.
That's ten.
And the third argument that we plug in is
our probability of success 0.1.
This yields a probability of roughly 26%.
Therefore our P value is roughly 26%,
which is once again
greater than 5%, so we would fail to
reject the null hypothesis.
Let's go back to our note sheet and take a
note of when n is equal to 10, the
number of yellow M&M's was 2, and our p
value
that we calculated was 0.26 with p value
of 0.26.
We stick with the null hypothesis, we
don't
reject it and pay favor of the
alternative.
Now let's see what would happen if we had
a sample size of 15 M&Ms.
Once again, the first ten are the same.
The next batch of five is yellow, red,
blue, red, red.
So the number of yellow M&Ms in this batch
of 15 is three.
Therefore our P value can be calculated as
probability of three or more yellows.
Given that the probability of success is
0.10 and we have a sample size of 15.
You know the drill by now.
We have a binomial distribution where p is
equal to 0.10 and n is equal to 15.
So how do we calculate the p value.
The p value is simply probability that the
number of successes is
greater than or equal to three, and making
use of r we
can see that this probability comes out to
be roughly 18%, and,
with a p value of approximately 18%, which
is greater than 5%.
We would once again fail to reject the
null hypothesis.
Well, add this to our little score card,
as well.
And, once again, see that we would stick
with the null hypothesis.
And, not reject it in favor of the
alternative.
To complete the story, let's take a look
if what would
happen if we had decided on a sample size
of 20.
This is what the sample size would look
like, and the additional
five, the new batch that we purchased, is
green, orange, red, blue, yellow.
And in this case, the number of yellow
M&Ms is four, so
our P value can be calculated as
probability as four or more yellows.
Given that the probability of success is
10% and we have a sample size of 20.
With a binomial distribution, where P is
equal to 0.10 and N is equal to 20.
We can calculate the P value as the
probability of number of successes being
greater than
or equal to 4, and we can quickly use R to
give us this probability once again.
Remember, we're using the dbinom function
to evaluate
all binomial probabilities, for number of
successes ranging
from 4 to 20 with a sample size of 4 and a
probability of success of 10%.
And we want to sum over all of these, and
this yields a probability of roughly 13%
with a p value of roughly 13% we once
again fail to reject the knot hypothesis.
So with every single possible approach
that we
could have taken in terms of our sample
size.
Our decision would be to stick with the
null
hypothesis, and not reject it in favor of
the alternative.
Let's go back to our decision table.
Basically, our decision is to stick with
percentage of yellow M&M's is equal to
10%.
So, we're on the first row, here.
And, we know that one of two things have
happened.
Either the true percentage of yellow M&Ms
is 10%,
and you made the right decision, and your
boss
gives you a bonus, or the true percentage
of
yellow M&Ms is 20%, and you lose your job.
Well actually, I happen to know the true
state of the
population, because I have been selecting
these M&Ms randomly from this population.
And remember this is what one of your
samples looked like.
This is the largest sample that you have.
And at each stage, we had exactly 20% M&Ms
actually, one out of
5, two out of 10, three out of 15, four
out of 20.
So really the true proportion of M&Ms in
this population is 20% and
what happen is you made the wrong decision
and you are going to lose your job.
Next we're going to start over with a
Bayesian approach.
So we're going start over with 1:1 odds,
that the percentage of yellows is 10% or
20%.
These are going to be our prior
probabilities, we're starting
with 1:1 odds, because we really don't
know any better.
So starting without seeing any data, the
probability that we
assume that the true percentage of yellow
of M&Ms is
10% is 0.5 and the probability that we
assume that
the true percentage of yellow M&Ms is 20%
is also 0.5.
We're going to use the same data set and
Bayes' theorem, to calculate the
probability of either hypothesis being
true given the observed data.
So that is our posterior probability.
We start with our priors, we incorporate
our data and then we calculate our
posterior
probability as a probability as of the
given hypothesis being true, given the
observed data.
Let's remind ourselves quickly of the
Bayes' theorem.
The Bayes theorem states that A given B.
Is equal to the probability of A and B
divided by the probability of E.
So for example, if we want to find the
probability
that 10% of the M&Ms are yellow given the
data that
we observe, we could write this out as
probability of data,
and 10% yellow divided by the probability
of the observed data.
And this could further be expanded, to say
probability
of data given 10% yellow, times
probability 10% yellow.
Divided by the probability of observed
data.
So what we've done in the numerator here,
is actually used the Bayes' theorem one
more time.
To say probability of b given a.
Times probability of a, is also going to
be
the probability of p and a because
remember,
that probability of a and b, and
probability
of b and a are equivalent to each other.
Then, using the same idea, we could
calculate
the probability of 20% yellow, given the
observed data.
As, probability of the observed data,
given 20% yellow.
Times probability of 20% yellow, divided
by the observe data.
Or, since we know that the only two
possible choices we're considering are 10%
yellow or 20% yellow, these two outcomes
must be compliments of each other.
So probability of 20% yellow, given the
data.
Could also be calculated as simply 1 minus
the probability of 10% yellow given the
data.
That's a lot of formulas.
Let's go ahead and put this into practice
and take it one
step at a time to see what we were exactly
talking about there.
Let's start with a sample size of five
again.
Remember, this is what the first batch of
five looked like.
So, we had one yellow M&M here.
That was our observed data.
Our prior probabilities are 50% for each
of the hypothesis we're considering and
the posterior
probability of our hypothesis of 10%
yellow is
simply probability of p is equal to 10%.
Given the observed data.
So how might we go about calculating this.
Let's remind ourselves.
Our data says that our sample sizes is
five, and our number of successes is one.
That's the one yellow in the sample size
of five.
The posterior probability that we want to
calculate is P
is equal to 10% given the data that we
have observed.
We show that in the numerator this means
probability of the observed data given P
is equal to 10% times the prior
probability that P is equal to 10%.
In the denominator, we need to consider
the
two possible ways the data could have
arisen.
We could have observed these data because
p was
equal to 10%, or because p was equal to
20%.
And when we say or in statistics, we add
the two probabilities.
So the two probabilities that we want to
add in the denominator are either
the same as what we have in the numerator,
that is one option.
Or the probability that the data occurred,
given that p was equal to
20%, times the prior probability of p
being equal to 20%.
How do we calculate this first probability
data given p equals 10%?
This is simply a binomial probability
where the number of successes
is one, the sample size is five and the
probability of success is 0.1.
So, that comes out to be roughly 33%.
So in the numerator we have 0.33 times
0.5, which is
the prior probability we assigned to p
being equal to 10%.
That same quantity is going to appear in
our denominator but next
we consider the other possible option, the
probability of these data happening.
That is one success out of five trials.
If the true probability of success was,
instead
of 10, 20%, how would we calculate this
probability?
That comes out to be 0.41 times the 0.5
for the prior probability of p being equal
to 20%.
This gives us a posterior of roughly 44%.
Let's start keeping a scorecard for the
posterior probabilities
that we obtain from the Bayesian approach,
as well.
We saw that in this first batch of five
M&Ms, where the number of yellow M&Ms was
1.
Our posterior probability for the
hypothesis that
percentage of yellow M&Ms is 10% was 0.44.
Therefore, the posterior probability for
the percentage of yellow M&Ms being
20%, given the observed data, is going to
be the complement of this, 0.56.
To make a decision between these two
hypotheses, we
want to think about which one is more
likely.
Well, in this case, the second hypothesis
is more likely, because the posterior
probability associated
with the second hypothesis is slightly
higher than
the posterior probability associated with
the first hypothesis.
We could actually get a little fancier
here, and start considering some costs
associated with
choosing one hypothesis over another and
consider
these posterior probabilities in context
of these costs.
But we're just going to assume that those
are equal for the two hypotheses,
and simply pick the hypothesis with the
higher posterior since that is basically
the hypothesis.
That we are determining to be more likely
given the data that we have observed.
Lets see how our decisions would pan out
if we had the sample size of ten.
Remember this is what our sample size
looked like and we
had two yellow's out of the ten M&M's that
we sampled.
And our prior probabilities are going to
stay the same.
Again, we're kind of starting from scratch
and assuming how would
the calculations pan out if we had a
sample size of ten.
And our posterior probability would still
be calculated as the
probability of P equaling to 10% given the
observed data.
In this case our observed data is
different and
is equal to ten, k is equal to two.
The calculation of our posterior
probability will be
very similar to what we had done before
indeed.
The components that go into the
calculations of the posterior are the
same.
What's going to change is the values of
the probability
of the observed data given p is equal to
10%.
or the probability of the observed data
given P
is equal to 20% because our data have
changed.
In this case remember we have said our
sample
size is ten and our number of successes is
two.
Data given P is equal to 10% comes out to
be 19% and the probability
of the data given P is equal to 20% comes
out to be roughly 0.3.
In this case our posterior probability is
calculated to be approximately 39%.
So we can enter this next posterior
probability in our score card, as when n
is equal to 10, and the number of yellow
M&Ms in the first batch is 2.
Our posterior probability associated with
the hypothesis.
Percentage of yellow M&Ms is 10% is
calculated to be approximately 39%, and
therefore the
posterior count associated with the other
hypothesis, is
going to be 1 minus 0.39, or 0.61.
In this case, once again, the
posterior probability associated with the
second hypothesis
is higher, so we would decide to choose
the second hypothesis over the first.
Hopefully we're starting to get the hang
of this.
What would happen if we had a sample size
of 15?
This is is what sample would look like, we
had three yellow M&Ms.
Our priors are exactly the same.
Our posterior is exactly the same that
we're interested in.
What has changed is our data.
In this case our sample size is 15, and
our number of successes is three.
Our posterior probability can be
calculated using the same approach.
And once again, what changes are going to
be the probability
of the observed data given p is equal to
10 or 20%.
And the probability of the observed data
given p is equal to 10% is roughly 13%.
And the probability of the observed data
given pz equals to 20% is roughly
25% then the posterior probability comes
out to be roughly 34%.
Let's go back to our scorecard and enter
that.
And then we can once again calculate
the posterior probability associated with
the other hypothesis.
As the complements of 1 minus 0.34, gives
us 0.66.
Once again, the posterior probability
associated with the second hypothesis
is higher, so if we were choosing based on
the
posterior probabilities, we would choose
the second hypothesis, percentage of
yellows is 20% over the first percentage
of yellows as 10%.
Lastly, let's take a look at a sample size
of 20.
This is what our sample of 20 looked like
and remember we have four yellow M&Ms.
We are once again using the same priors
because remember, we're
at each stage assuming that we were
starting from scratch and what
would have been the decision that we make,
if we had initially
decided to go with 20 M&Ms is the question
we're asking here.
And the posterior probability that we're
interested in is the
probability that p is equal to 10% given
the observed data.
And what we mean by the observed data is a
sample size of 20, and a number of success
of four.
Going through the motions one more time,
we can write out the
calculation of our posterior probability
in exactly the same way as before.
And remember, what's changing is the
probability of the observed
data given that either of the hypotheses
that we're evaluating.
And the first probability of the observed
data given.
A 10% rate of success is 0.08 and the
other one is 0.22.
Which yields a posterior probability of
29% roughly.
A posterior probability of 0.29 associated
with the first hypothesis.
Means a posterior probability of one minus
0.29 or 0.71 associated with a second
hypothesis.
And since the posterior probability for
the
second hypothesis is higher we would once
again
choose the second over the first and
decide
that we should stick with 20% yellow M&Ms.
Here's a summary of all the probabilities
that we've calculated.
On the left, we have the results from the
frequentist approach, our p values.
And on the right, we have the
results from the bayesian approach, our
posterior probabilities.
And the frequentist approach, our null
hypothesis was p is equal
to 10%, and our alternative was p is equal
to 20%.
All of our p values were greater than
our significance level, and therefore at
each stage,
we decided to stick with the null and not
reject it in favor of the alternative.
In the Bayesian approach, the posterior
probabilities
associated with the second hypothesis were
consistently higher.
Therefore, using the Bayesian approach at
each stage.
We decided to choose the second hypothesis
over the first one.
Clearly, the results from the two
approaches are contradictory,
but which one seems to be there right
approach here?
Well, here we're saying that using the
Bayesian approach,
we're deciding to stick with p is equal to
20%.
And earlier we had revealed that that was
indeed
the true state of the population, so it
seems
like that's going to allow you to make the
right decision, and you get that bonus
from your boss.
So in this video, we got a
chance to review calculating binomial
probabilities, calculating p
values, calculating posterior
probabilities, and we also
demonstrated that sometimes, the two
approaches to inference.
Frequentist or Bayesian, may yield
slightly different results.
